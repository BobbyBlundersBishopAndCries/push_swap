# Illustrating the mid value algorithm (chunks algo) with examples

first we take a stack a initalized with non repeated integer values : 

1- put it into an array and sort the array

2- get the mid index value and the mid size as well(as shown in the picture)

the same algorithm until a has the big values in ascending order:

using the chunks I have I should be able to sort the stack b in descending way (top of the stack / head of the stack has the biggest number and so on)
